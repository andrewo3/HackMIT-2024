He was born on January 27, 1756, in Salzburg, which was then part of the Holy Roman Empire, and he died on December 5, 1791, in Vienna.\n\nMozart showed extraordinary musical talent from a very young age, composing his first piece at the age of five and performing before European royalty shortly thereafter. He was a child prodigy who traveled throughout Europe with his family, showcasing his skills on the piano and violin.\n\nThroughout his life, Mozart composed over 600 works, including symphonies, operas, chamber music, choral music, and concertos. Some of his most famous works include operas like \"The Magic Flute,\" \"Don Giovanni,\" and \"The Marriage of Figaro,\" as well as symphonies such as Symphony No. 40 and No. 41 (the \"Jupiter Symphony\").\n\nMozart's music is celebrated for its melodic beauty, formal elegance, and emotional depth. He was a key figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in music. Despite his immense talent, he struggled financially and faced various personal challenges throughout his life. After his death at the age of 35, he was largely forgotten for a time, but his music has since gained immense popularity and is now considered a cornerstone of the classical music repertoire."}{"Input": "asdf", "Output": "It looks like your message might have been a typo or an incomplete thought.
